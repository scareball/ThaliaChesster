                            <li>As far as possible, to remove hazards within the venue that could cause serious injury to children and young people using our services, or to our volunteers.</li>
                            <li>Where such hazards cannot be removed, to put in place procedures and processes that protect children and adults from potential harm caused by hazards;</li>
                            <li>To ensure that we take a balanced and proportionate approach to accident prevention, so that volunteers can do their work effectively, and so that children and young people can be adventurous, and can learn to understand and deal with risks as they grow up;</li>
                            <li>To provide volunteers with the overarching principles that guide our approach to accident prevention;</li>

                            <li>the welfare of the children/young people who come into contact with our services is paramount and should govern our approach to accident prevention;</li>
                            <li>all children and adults, regardless of age, disability, gender, racial heritage, religious belief, sexual orientation or identity, have the right to equal protection from serious injury;</li>
                            <li>risk assessment needs to take account of children’s changing needs as they grow and develop, and should be mindful of needs resulting from disability and factors that may make some children more vulnerable than others;</li>
                            <li>working in partnership with children, young people, their parents, carers and other agencies is essential in promoting young people’s welfare and in helping young people and adults to be responsible in their approach to accident prevention;</li>
                            <li>we cannot and should not try to create a completely risk-free environment, as this would prevent us from being able to carry out any meaningful work with children and young people and would not be in their best interests; our emphasis is therefore on preventing serious or avoidable accidents and on managing risk appropriately.</li>

                            <li>informing volunteers, parents, carers and young people of their responsibilities to keep themselves safe, and making sure that they understand these and all relevant accident prevention procedures;</li>
